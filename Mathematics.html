    <p><b>2022</b>:
<p><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10871?context=cs.LO>Elimination and cut-elimination.</a> Part of the content of a proof net is the identification of different occurrences of the same formula in a proof. Taking this seriously, we define a ring \( R_{\pi} \) associated to a proof net which is the quotient of a polynomial ring \( P_{\pi} \). The indeterminants of \( P_{\pi} \) come from the (atomic axioms of the) formulas in \( \pi \), and the kernel \( I_{\pi} \) of the quotient map \( P_{\pi} \longrightarrow R_{\pi} \) comes from the links of \( \pi \). If there exists a multi-step reduction of a proof \( \gamma: \pi \longrightarrow \pi' \) to a normal form \( \pi' \) then the generators of the ideals \( I_{\pi}, I_{\pi'} \) are related to one another via the Buchberger Algorithm, a <em>pre-existing</em> algorithm used to calculate Gr&#246;bner bases from generating sets. In the case where \( \pi' \) is not normal, the reduction can still be related to the Buchberger Algorithm, but with a small adaptation made. In fact, this altered version of the Buchberger Algorithm is more naturally expressed as a new algorithm which we present in this paper, the so called <em>falling roofs</em> algorithm.

<p><a href="http://williamtroiani.github.io/pdfs/FiniteColimitsInternalLanguageTaAC.pdf">The internal logic and topoi.</a> Topoi are often described as “generalised theories of sets”, but are they? This description is often given to topoi due to the similarities of the internal logic with ZF set theory. However, there are important differences, which extend further than just the fact that the internal language of a topos is an <em>intuitionistic</em> logic (and ZF <em>classical</em>). Even in Boolean topoi, where the law of exluded middle holds, <em>still</em> there is the following difference between the theories: the existence of the union of an arbitrary collection of sets is an axiom of ZF, and the product is intrinsically defined, but in the internal language this is reverseed; there is a product type constructor, and the union of two subobjects only makes sense in the context of a common parent object. This difference is not visible in ZF set theory during usual mathematical discorse, but when importing the usual set theoretic definitions of mathematical objects into the internal language, this distinction becomes significant. How these hurdles arrise and how they are solved is the content of this document.

<p><b>2020:</b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10131">Gentzen-Mints-Zucker Duality.</a> A duality consists of two different points of view on the same object. The greater the difference between the two points of view, the more informative is the duality which relates them. Such correspondences are important because two independent discoveries of the same structure is strong evidence that the structure is natural. The duality between the simply typed λ-calculus (without product types) and the intuitionistic sequent calculus is the content of this document, and is interesting precisely because sequent calculus proofs and lambda terms are not tautologically the same thing: for example the cut-elimination relations are fundamentally local
while the β-equivalence relation is global (see Section 4.3). In this sense sequent calculus and λ-calculus are respectively local and global points of view on a common logicocomputational mathematical structure.</p>
<p><b>2017</b>: <a href="https://github.com/WilliamTroiani/linearlambdacalculus/tree/master/Working%20code"><span class="s2">A proof tree constructor for the Linear Lambda Calculus.</span></a> The λ-lambda calculus is a syntactic system designed with Girard's linear logic in sight. The idea is simple: since the Curry-Howard correspondence holds between intuitionistic natural deduction and the simply typed λ-calculus, and since the intuitionistic sequent calculus embeds into the linear logic sequent calculus, one may conjecture the existence of a "linear λ-calculus". Such a system has been designed, and the content of this document is a passer which takes as input a term in the linear λ-calculus and provides html code which displays the (necessarily unique) term-constructing tree corresponding to this term. For example, the term \( \lambda q \lambda p. \texttt{copy } q \texttt{ as } r, s \texttt{ in } \lambda z. \texttt{derelict}(p)(\texttt{derelict}(s)(\texttt{derelict}(r)z)) \) has the following diagram associated to it.

<h2><b>Taming the frame (2021),</b> a mathematical commentary on an artwork created by <a href="https://www.nobbyseymour.com.au/">Nobby Seymour</a></h2>
<p>
Nobby's statement:
<br>
<br><i>Nature (in the form of gravity and as a commanding higher voice) has had its say; now for a more rigorous formal approach.
<br>    
<br>Using the integer 1 and the first four prime numbers, 2, 3, 5 and 7, I constructed a Cartesian grid centred on x and y = 0. I plotted all possible positive and negative values of the x and y coordinates (48 in all) and these formed the vertices of a square grid. Then I selected the 24 outmost coordinates and these served as the centrepoint of circles whose circumference passed through the midpoint of the previously established grid squares. This formed an interlocking path of arc quadrants which form the (blue) trajectory above, reminiscent of patterns in in early Chinese and Islamic Design. The central void also appealed to me, for reasons at this stage unfathomable.
<br>
<br>I was pleased to see the frame as a trajectory, emerging from the geometric matrix that shapes much of our world.
There is a famous optical illusion2 in which some people see a duck, others a rabbit. My friend Will Troiani, who has tutored me over the years in mathematics I have required for various projects, turns up at the studio, looks at my Trajectory and sees a beautiful algorithm lurking there.
<br>
        <br>Before we reach the concluding work, Taming the Frame, I am delighted by any confluence of visual theory and science, Take it away Will.</i>
