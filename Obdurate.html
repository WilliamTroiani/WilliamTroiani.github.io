    <p><i>Tear ducts will push an eyelash away
<br>Noses and ears will catch foreign objects
<br>But what if a hair was caught behind an eye ball?
<br>Or got through the hole in the drum before healing?
<br>What if this happened before modern medicine?
<br>A soul got caught in a person before birth?
<br>All human suffering, a machine factory accident
<br>Remaining until inevitable rot, the earth is the same
<br>Tears of fury would fight to ignore it
<br>Curing tinnitus by avoiding quiet spaces
<br>A conscious universe impaired and frustrated
<br>      
<br>      The fight is between ignored and ignorant
<br>To abstain from a person never before felt merciful
<br>To give people meaning we tell them to find it
<br>Correctly telling people what not to do
<br>Living this fringe is perfect for cinema
<br>"An opera of stars who find me annoying
<br>Inflicting more harm, I beg to be trivial"
<br>These thoughts are thought during a period of patience
<br>This patience is demanded, it takes time to reach planets
<br>Perpetually debilitating the love I love most
<br>I love you, I'm sorry, I'm trying to leave you
<br>Process of elimination removes me completely</i></p>

      The thoughts were pretty so why aren't these pictures?
<br>Years of work towards tears of frustration,
<br>Tempting a junkie with routine and chores,
<br>Research is easy, another human whatever,
<br>For every power there's an animal, kinda falling flat,
<br>An adult with blind spots, diagnosed with Sisyphus,
<br>Trade off is torture, reflectionâ€™s humiliating,
<br>Arms locking windows, dry swallowing pills,
<br>      
<br>Intricate vocabulary, delicately navigating a complex diary,
<br>Frequenting the start, new details each time,
<br>A mausoleum echoes when somebody knocks,
<br>Your child will hurt, prepare them for echo,
<br>Did they grow up past getting caught cheating?
<br>"Be brave and useful, carry the support?"
<br>Open to wisdom, opening up to wisdom, always attempting to be open to wisdom...
<br>Worry over porn while they click on a snuff film,
