title: About

<p>The collision of mathematics, logic, and computer science has captured my fascination ever since I began having conversations with <a href = "http://www.therisingsea.org/">Daniel Murfet</a> (University of Melbourne) in the 2016, the final year of my undergraduate studies (Bachelor of Science (Mathematics and Statistics), University of Melbourne).

At the time I had just finished a <a href = "https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/vacation-scholarships">vacation scholarship</a> project sponsored by <a href = "https://researchers.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~pjforr@unimelb/">Peter Forrester</a> (University of Melbourne) and was curious if the same kind of coupling which exists between Physics and Mathematics also existed between Computer Science and Mathematics.

After reading Murfet's paper <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2650">Logic and Linear Algebra: an Introduction</a> I was hooked. Two years later, I submitted a thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Master of Science (University of Melbourne) titled "(Finite) Simplicial Sets are Algorithms", more can be found on this <a href = "https://williamtroiani.github.io/2019/06/01/Will-Troiani-Finite-Simplicial-Sets.html">here</a>.

During the Master of Science (Mathematics and Statistics), I was working as a research assistant for Daniel Murfet where I contributed to a <a href = "http://www.therisingsea.org/post/seminar-ch/">seminar series</a> exploring the connections between type theory and topos theory. How this theory extends to the modern setting of infinity topoi is of high interest to me, I would particularly like to see if higher topoi are relevant to the ideas explored in my aforementioned thesis. How systems of logic are "geometrically realised" is a running theme in my interests.

When I am not working on Mathematics, I enjoy playing drums in my band <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43HZqzlBEGQ">Telos</a>. There is so much untapped potential for heavy styles of music to be impactful in an original way. Telos try to achieve this by focusing on rhythm, harmony, and song structure.
