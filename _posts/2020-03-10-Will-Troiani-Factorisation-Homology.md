title: "Factorisation Homology as a Knot Invariant"
date: 2020-03-10

I am currently working under the supervision of <a href = "http://www.marcyrobertson.com/">Marcy Robertson</a> (University of Melbourne) on a project exploring factorisation homology. Our inspiration is Remark 4.14 of <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0848">Factorisation Homology of Stratified Spaces<\a> (Ayala, Francis, Tanaka). Our aim is to understand this remark but without all the overhead of infinity categories. Please note that this project is in very early days.
