In the December of 2015 I was fortunate enough to be rewarded an <a href = "https://vrs.amsi.org.au/about/"> AMSI vacation research scholarship</a>, where I was supervised by <a href = "http://www.therisingsea.org/">Daniel Murfet</a> to work on a project whose description can be found <a href = "https://github.com/WilliamTroiani/linearlambdacalculus/blob/master/ResearchProject.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
