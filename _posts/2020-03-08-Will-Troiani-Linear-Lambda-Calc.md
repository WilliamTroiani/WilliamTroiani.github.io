In the December of 2015 I was fortunate enough to be rewarded an <a href = "https://vrs.amsi.org.au/about/"> AMSI vacation research scholarship</a>, where I was supervised by <a href = "http://www.therisingsea.org/">Daniel Murfet</a> to work on a project whose description can be found <a href = "https://WilliamTroiani.github.io/pdfs/ResearchProject.pdf">here</a>.

We did not come close to fulfilling this dream, however what we did achieve is explained in this <a href = "https://WilliamTroiani.github.io/pdfs/Poster.pdf">poster</a>.

The Term Calculus we used is defined in <a href = "https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/Research/Pub91-00/bbdphtlca93.pdf">this</a> paper, and links to the code as well as a text file explaining how the code works can be found <a href = "https://github.com/WilliamTroiani/linearlambdacalculus/tree/master/Working%20code">here</a>. There is also code for producing an HTML ready output for a more pleasing visual experience.
