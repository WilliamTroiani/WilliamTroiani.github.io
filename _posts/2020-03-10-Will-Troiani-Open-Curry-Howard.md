In 2017 I worked on a project with Daniel Murfet on extending the Curry-Howard Correspondence to include open terms on the calculus side.

In 2020 we picked up this project again and are still working on this. The most current, relevent files (including an introduction) can be found <a href = "https://williamtroiani.github.io/pdfs/OpenCurryHowardDan.pdf">here</a> and <a href = "https://williamtroiani.github.io/pdfs/OpenCurryHoward/pdf">here</a>.
